Any modern linux terminal with mouse support should work.
I'm using crossterm so windows will probably work, but it's not tested.

Paint using the mouse
Press ctrl-c or q to quit
Press any other key to show/hide the color and tool menu
Any other key will hide/show the tools and palette

### Building

Install any modern version of rust and run `cargo run`

Of course for best experience you can always use the provided `nix develop` shell :)
