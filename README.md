## Painting app in your terminal.

Any modern terminal with mouse support should work.
I'm using crossterm so windows will probably work, but it's not tested.

Controls are what you expect
Press ctrl-c or q to quit
Any other key will hide/show the tools and palette

### Building

Install any modern version of rust and run `cargo run`

Of course for best experience you can always use the provided `nix develop` shell :)
